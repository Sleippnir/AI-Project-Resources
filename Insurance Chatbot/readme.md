# AI Insurance Assistant Chatbot ü§ñ


## Project Description

This project is the final deliverable for the Anyone AI course, designed to tackle key challenges in the insurance industry by applying cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence. The main goal is to create a chatbot agent that acts as an assistant and advisor for insurance companies, optimizing tedious and time-consuming processes like document generation and policy consultation.

The chatbot uses Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, to generate accurate and relevant answers. It is also integrated with a database of existing policies, allowing it to efficiently retrieve and analyze information to help create new ones. Additionally, the chatbot can search and summarize the latest news from the insurance sector, providing users with up-to-date information.

## Key Features ‚ú®

The chatbot assistant is designed to provide the following core functionalities:

- Policy-Based Answers: Answers questions about existing insurance policies by consulting an internal database.
- News Search and Summarization: Searches for relevant news on the internet about the insurance sector and creates concise summaries.
- Policy Generation (Optional): The ability to recombine sections from different policies to create new documents.

## Technologies and Tools üõ†Ô∏è

This project was developed using a modern and robust tech stack:

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
- **Large Language Models (LLMs):** OpenAI GPT.
- **Vector Database:** Pinecone.
- **NLP Frameworks:** Deepset Haystack, LangChain.
- **Text Search:** ElasticSearch.
- **APIs:** HTTP APIs.
- **Containerization:** Docker.
- **User Interface:** FastAPI, Streamlit, or Chainlit.

## Main Deliverables üöÄ

The following are the key deliverables required to complete the project:

1. Exploratory Dataset Analysis (EDA): An analysis of the policy dataset.
2. Data Preparation: Scripts for preprocessing and preparing the text data.
3. Document Indexing: Scripts to store text data in a vector database for efficient searching.
4. Search and Generation System: A system that searches for relevant documents and uses a generative model to create answers.
5. Internet Search: A feature to search for news online and add that information to the responses.
6. LangChain Agents: Implementation of agents to direct the user's query to the correct tool (policy database or internet search).
7. API: An API (e.g., using FastAPI) to handle user requests.
8. User Interface (UI): A simple, chat-like interface for user interaction.
9. Containerization: The entire system must be packaged and ready for deployment using Docker.
10. Presentation and Demo: A live demo of the running system.
